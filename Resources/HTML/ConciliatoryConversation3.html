		<h1>Four Levels of Forgiveness</h1>
		The four levels of forgiveness are invoked by proceeding backwards
		through the Four Levels of the Problem. Your note taking in the
		previous steps will come in handy here!
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em> "Knowing what I know now..."</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Level 4: Root Cause</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em>"I can see how my
				unwillingness to..."</em> and state how you resisted God's grace.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Level 3: Root Problem</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em> "Caused you to feel unloved
				or disrespected..."</em> and state the character qualities you failed
				to demonstrate.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Level 2: Surface Causes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em>"And made you believe...
				fear... remember... experience..."</em> and state the effect of
				your words or actions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Level 1: Surface Problem</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em>"Because of my actions or
				words of..."</em>and state the content of your words or actions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em>"Will you please forgive
				me?"</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		At this point, you will have demonstrated that you have insight into
		their true condition.
		<br>
		<h2>Additional Information</h2>
		At this point you may have some additional information that you might
		be able to give that will provide clarity to the situation.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say <em>"Would you like to know
				any additional facts so you can ease your mind regarding this
				situation?"</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Or say <em>"I have some additional
				information that might be helpful in understanding this situation
				better, would you like me to share it now or at some other time?"</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Describe your intent in sharing or doing what you did.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Understanding a person's intent will help your spouse associate
						a new and more accurate meaning to the content ofyour words and
						actions. Our feelings are often controlled by the meaning we associate
						to words and actions. Change the meaning and you will change the
						feelings.
					</li>
					<li>
						Discovering the truth will overcome the F.E.A.R.s (False
						Evidence that Appears Real) and it will set you free from the lies of
						the enemy. This requires listening to one another's facts, meaning and
						then deciphering the truth and being willing to once again believe the
						best, hope the best and endure to see the best. When we become
						allies instead of enemies, we help one another become vulnerable enough
						to share from the heart the facts, feelings, fears, failures,
						weaknesses, needs and then finally the truth that will help both to once
						again enter into God's rest. (See Hebrews 4)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
