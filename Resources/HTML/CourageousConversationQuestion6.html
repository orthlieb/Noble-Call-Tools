		This question is one the speaker is totally unprepared for because they
		have probably taken on the role of a victim. With this question you
		help them begin to move out of being a victim into a response-able
		person. They can begin to share in the responsibility of resolving this
		issue. The turning point of the whole conversation starts with this
		question. People who are speaking begin to show mercy to the listener
		if they have demonstrated humility, mourning, meekness and a hunger and
		thirst for righteousness. Some people will maintain a victim mindset.
		It is easier for a mediator to deal with this issue than a person who
		is part of the issue. If I am part
		of the issue I simply say <em>&ldquo;What I hear you saying is&hellip;.&rdquo;</em><br>
