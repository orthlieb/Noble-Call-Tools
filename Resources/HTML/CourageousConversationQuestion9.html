		Questions 8 &amp; 9 have to do with making Powerful Plans. This
		question helps us focus on one thing that will make all the difference
		if we execute it with consistency and excellence. We are looking for
		one thing that will help us move towards the preferable future. It is
		an idea such as <em>&ldquo;We cannot fail to communicate.&rdquo;</em> It
		is an objective that is simply understood by everyone. For a doctor
		going into surgery, the one thing he cannot fail to do is wash his
		hands well or everything else he does will be rendered inconsequential.
		What is the one thing that you cannot fail to do or everything else
		will be rendered inconsequential? Understanding this one thing puts you
		on the path to making
		peace.
