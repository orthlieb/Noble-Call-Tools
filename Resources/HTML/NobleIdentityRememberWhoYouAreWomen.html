		<h1>Remember Who You Are</h1>
		I am part of the family of God. I have been chosen and reconciled to
		God, and restored as a new creation in Christ Jesus. I am a woman, made
		in God's image and for His glory. I am flesh of my husband's flesh and
		bone of his bone. I am a virtuous woman in Christ Jesus and my value is
		far above rubies. God has chosen me before the foundation of
		the world that I should be holy and without blame before Him in love. I
		have been adopted by the Father through Jesus Christ, according to the
		good pleasure of His will wherein He hath made me accepted in the
		beloved. I have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
		according to the riches of His grace, that I should be to the praise of
		His glory. He is my midst, mighty to save and rejoicing over me with
		shouts of joy. I am His bride and He is my Bridegroom and I am
		responsible to be the unhindered conduit of God's love to my husband. I
		am called to honor him, releasing the grace of God in his life, so that
		he can lead our family in paths
		of righteousness according to the
		Father's perfect will.
