		<h1>Why Have a Connecting Conversation?</h1>
		You want to be intentional in maintaining a strong connection. Mutual
		self-revelation is the way to developing connection and intimacy.
		In-to-me-see is one definition that explains what we are all asking for
		in relationship. We want to be known and not alone.You are
		updating your love map of each other when you connect on all 9
		levels.

		<h1>How Do I Have a Connecting Conversation?</h1>
		Safety, honesty, and vulnerability are necessary for connecting
		conversations. The key to becoming irresistible is not how interesting
		we are but how interested we are. Become curious about one another and
		don't be threatened by the change that takes place when people grow.
		Change is inevitable but growth is optional.The speed by which
		you move through the levels of connection is determined by the degree
		of trust you have and the safety you are providing one another to be
		vulnerable. Each level requires greater risk but comes with greater
		rewards. When you stay at the first three levels it is less risky like
		putting money in a bank or CD at 1% but at least your not losing.&nbsp;
		Angry foolish reactions take huge emotional withdraws.You can
		casually go through each level by asking a question related to the
		level or you can choose a topic to connect on and go through each level
		within the context of the topic. i.e.(children, finances, chores,
		sex, upcoming trip)
