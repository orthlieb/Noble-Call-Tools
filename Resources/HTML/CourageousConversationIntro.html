<h1>The Ten Questions of a
Courageous Conversation</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic;">NB:
these notes are from
the Noble Call website and Chris Hogan's <a
 href="http://www.noblecall.org/articles/partner/the-10-questions-of-a-courageous-conversation">article
on the ten questions</a>.
It is not only important that you know the questions but also
understand the goal of the conversation and the thinking and nuances
behind each question.</p>
<p>If
you have heard me speak recently, you may have heard me talk about
having a Courageous Conversation. These are conversations that require
us to blend two key elements of mercy and truth in order to resolve
pressing issues and at the same time develop greater levels of trust in
our relationship. Proverbs 16:6 states "By mercy and truth iniquity is
purged: and by the fear of the&nbsp;LORD&nbsp;men depart from
evil. " The iniquities of self-will, and our pride is what causes so
much of the tension in our relationships. Our pride reveals itself in
our conversations when we say to ourselves, &ldquo;we will have had
a good conversation when you listen to me and agree that I&rsquo;m
right.&rdquo; This form of conversation does not include
God&rsquo;s mercy and truth which sets us free, but it focuses on
our own rights and expectations which cause wars among us as James 4
points out so clearly.</p>
<p>When
I have helped mediate courageous conversations where people have been
more interested in seeking to give mercy and truth rather than being
right, I have seen truly miraculous reconciliation take place. God has
said &ldquo;And having made peace through the blood of His cross,
by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him, I say, whether
they be things in earth, or things in heaven.&rdquo; God has
already done his part, the question is will we receive the grace He has
already provided by humbling ourselves and allowing our iniquities to
be purged by His mercy and truth. When our sins are pointed out and we
humble ourselves and confess them, God cleanses us. I have seen people
become so free that they have a fresh fear of God come upon them as
they see His power made manifest in their lives and relationship. They
depart from further evil so they can experience a greater level of
intimacy and freedom in Christ.</p>
<p>The
three goals of a courageous conversation are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom to see from a
bigger perspective.</span>&nbsp;When
we see as God sees we will want to do as God does. The counsel of
others will broaden our perspective. God can even use a donkey to help
us see our blind spots. He will test our humility by sending us the
most unlikely messengers.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding that will
establish trust in the relationship.&nbsp;</span>When
we see from another&rsquo;s perspective we begin to understand why
they do what they do. When you seek to understand a person, it
doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to agree with them. When you provide
them a safe environment of mercy, it will allow them to see their own
false beliefs and begin to question their perspective if it is based on
lies. A man convinced against his own will is of the same opinion
still. Our goal is to look with another person at their own thoughts
and beliefs so they consider the trustworthiness of their perspective.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Knowledge so we can take
the next step.</span>&nbsp;When
people gain wisdom and understanding by allowing the beatitudes of
Christ to control their spirit, soul and body, then God will grant them
the knowledge of His will to resolve any issue.</li>
</ul>
