		<h1>Husband As Listener</h1>
		<p>
			Lord,
		</p>
		<p >
			I am willing to be made
			willing by Your grace. Give me the ear of the wise. Help me to
			understand my wife and live with her in understanding, that our prayers
			would not be hindered, and that we would be able to resolve every issue
			that comes up. Enable us to cast all these burdens on You. So Lord, I
			choose to be a willing man. I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m afraid. I
			don&rsquo;t know what I am going to face in this conversation. But
			Lord, give me the grace to be strong in the power of Your might.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amen
