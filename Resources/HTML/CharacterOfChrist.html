		<h1>What Is Character?</h1>
		Character is the inward motivation to do what is right according to the
		highest standards of behavior in every situation. Character consists of
		the stable and distinctive qualities built into an
		individual&rsquo;s life that determine his or her responses,
		regardless of the circumstances. Character is the wise response to the
		pressure of a difficult situation and what we do when we think that no
		one is watching. It is the predictor of good behavior. <h1>Character Qualities</h1>
		The Greek word for character is <span style="font-style: italic;">charakter</span>.
		It is translated in Scripture as the &ldquo;express
		image.&rdquo; According to The Complete Word Study Dictionary New
		Testament, the word &ldquo;originally denoted an engraver or
		engraving tool. Later it meant the impression itself, usually
		something engraven, cut in, or stamped, a character, letter, mark, [or]
		sign. This impression with its particular features was considered as
		the exact representation of the object whose image it bore.&rdquo;
		In Hebrews 1:3, Christ is referred to as the &ldquo;express
		image&rdquo; of God; He fully expressed the character of God
		through His life.
		<br>
		<br>
		One of God&rsquo;s primary goals for believers is to transform them
		into the image of His Son so that they may be a reflection of the
		character of Christ. We can take comfort in this purpose when we
		experience difficulties because &ldquo;We know that all things work
		together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
		according to his purpose&rdquo;
