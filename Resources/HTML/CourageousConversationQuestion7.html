		Questions 7 &amp; 8 are about the preferable future. This question
		turns the focus on what has been to what could and should be. It
		creates hope in the people because they begin to share a vision that
		both can agree on. When they realize how much they agree on their
		desired future they begin to walk together in agreement. This question
		begins to restore a sense of partnership and enthusiasm for what could
		and should be in their relationship and organization. God begins to
		give them a pure heart to see the future as he sees it, full of plans
		for good and not for evil.

		Restate what you heard them say the preferable future could be.
