		Andy Stanley wrote a book
		about the <em>&ldquo;Most Important Question&rdquo;</em>
		and he states it like this <em>&ldquo;What
		is the
		wisest step you should take based on past experience, present
		circumstances, and future hopes?&rdquo;</em>
		These are the steps you can put in your planner. It describes who will
		do what by when. These are highly leveraged steps that will yield the
		greatest results. They are the 20% activities that will yield 80% of
		your results.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>May God grant you the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual
		understanding that you may walk worthy of His noble calling and produce
		fruit that will stand the test of eternity as you make noble plans and
		carry out noble deeds.</strong>
