		<h1>Listener</h1>
		<p>
			I agree to hear you until you are satisfied that I have considered your trouble
			and known your soul in adversity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I agree to&hellip;
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Listen from your perspective
			</li>
			<li>
				Show respect by staying in the conversation
			</li>
			<li>
				Not complain, explain, or blame
			</li>
			<li>
				Restate the meaning of the message to your satisfaction
			</li>
			<li>
				Gain wisdom and develop understanding to establish a relationship of trust,
				and to use the knowledge to resolve our issues for good, not for evil
			</li>
		</ul>
		I agree to seek God&rsquo;s will for our lives and our relationship.
