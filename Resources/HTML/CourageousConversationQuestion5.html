		Questions 5 &amp; 6 deal with the personal responsibilities of
		those involved in the issue. When I ask this question I am showing a
		noble willingness to yield my rights and become meek and lowly, a
		servant like Christ, one who lays down his life for a brother. It also
		reveals a hunger and thirst for Christ&rsquo;s righteousness rather
		than defending my own. When I mediate courageous conversations this is
		the question most people fear to ask. It takes grace to die and lose
		your life, but God promises you will find it if you willingly lay it
		down. This question opens up the opportunity to really understand the
		heart of another, they want to share with you their real needs. If you
		begin to explain, complain or blame them in response to this question
		then you will have failed and turned a courageous conversation into a
		combustible one due to cowardice in not laying down your life.
		<br>
		<br>
		Rephrase what you heard the person say to their satisfaction. The goal
		of rephrasing their statement is to try and understand their heart. If
		they verbalized it well enough you can simply restate their comments,
		if
		God gives you further insight then be willing to share this as it comes
		to you. Do not try to make up new statements because you
		don&rsquo;t want to use their words, it will change the meaning. <strong>Our goal is to reveal that we do understand their heart.</strong>
