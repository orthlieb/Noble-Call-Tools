			<h1>What is your most pressing issue?</h1>
		<p>Questions 1 &amp; 2 deal with the <em>Pressing
		Issues.</em> Very rarely do I ever ask someone if they would like to
		have a courageous conversation. I simply realize that there is a
		problem because someone is either acting hurt or trying to get me to
		understand their viewpoint. When I see that a conversation is turning
		combustible because I don&rsquo;t feel understood or the other person
		is frustrated, it dawns on me that I need to humble myself and esteem
		the others need to be heard as greater than my own.&nbsp; This is the
		third beatitude of Jesus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<span class="biblequote">God
			blesses the humble, for they will inherit the whole earth.</span>&rdquo;
		I will simply say, <em>&ldquo;What I
		hear you saying is that your most pressing issue is&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
		or I will say <em>&ldquo;What I hear you
		saying is&hellip;, which of these is the most pressing issue?&rdquo;</em></p>
