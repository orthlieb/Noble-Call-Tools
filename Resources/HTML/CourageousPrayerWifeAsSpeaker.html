		<h1>Wife As Speaker</h1>
		<p>
			Lord,
		</p>
		<p>
			I give you myself, and ask that You would give me the words to
			speak to my husband, that I would not tear him down, but that we would
			be able to walk through this issue together. Give me sweetness of lips,
			but also let me express what is going on in my heart, so that I can
			sense that he knows me, and that You know me. I want to be able to
			glorify You, Father, and at the end of this conversation to be able to
			say, &ldquo;I praise You, Lord, for You have heard my voice.&rdquo; So,
			I receive now the tongue of the learned to speak the words that we need
			to talk about right now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amen
