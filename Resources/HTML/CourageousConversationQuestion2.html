		My goal in this question is to get to the real issue. I remind myself
		that most people may not be aware of how to describe their most
		pressing needs. I listen to what they say and try to see where one of
		two root issues may be causing the intense feelings.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Fear of Rejection</strong> &ndash;
				This issue or person is making me feel like I am unacceptable and I
				don&rsquo;t feel good about myself because of it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Fear of Failure</strong> &ndash;
				This issue or person is making me feel inadequate.
			</li>
		</ul>
		When I am working with couples I think about how the woman&rsquo;s most
		important question is being answered. I believe a woman asks herself
		constantly <em>&ldquo;Am I worth being
		pursued?&rdquo;</em>, so when her husband is not initiating the
		conversation or showing interest in her issues, she feels rejection.
		<br>
		<br>
		From my experience with men it seems the major question they are asking
		themselves is <em>&ldquo;Am I adequate,
		do I have what it takes to succeed?&rdquo;</em> When they feel like
		others view them as inadequate or their ability to succeed is hampered
		then they begin to experience tension.
		<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes people don&rsquo;t verbalize these root issues and I only
		bring them up if I sense they are willing to acknowledge that this fear
		is present, otherwise I let them determine their most pressing issue
		and agree to pursue this course with them.
		<br>
		<br>
		It is important that you write down the most pressing issue in a
		concise sentence because all the other questions will refer to this
		issue. <strong>You can only deal effectively
		with one issue at a time.</strong>
