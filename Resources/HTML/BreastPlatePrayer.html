		<h1>St. Patrick's Breastplate Prayer</h1>
		I arise today 
		<img src="./images/StPatrickCross.jpg" alt="St. Patrick's Cross" width=125 height=125 class="align-right frame"/>
		<br>
		Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
		<br>
		Through the belief in the threeness,
		<br>
		Through confession of the oneness
		<br>
		Of the Creator of Creation.
		<br>
		I arise today
		<br>
		Through the strength of Christ's birth with his baptism,
		<br>
		Through the strength of his crucifixion with his burial,
		<br>
		Through the strength of his resurrection with his ascension,
		<br>
		Through the strength of his descent for the judgment of Doom.
		<br>
		I arise today
		<br>
		Through the strength of the love of Cherubim,
		<br>
		In obedience of angels,
		<br>
		In the service of archangels,
		<br>
		In hope of resurrection to meet with reward,
		<br>
		In prayers of patriarchs,
		<br>
		In predictions of prophets,
		<br>
		In preaching of apostles,
		<br>
		In faith of confessors,
		<br>
		In innocence of holy virgins,
		<br>
		In deeds of righteous men.
		<br>
		I arise today
		<br>
		Through the strength of heaven:
		<br>
		Light of sun,
		<br>
		Radiance of moon,
		<br>
		Splendor of fire,
		<br>
		Speed of lightning,
		<br>
		Swiftness of wind,
		<br>
		Depth of sea,
		<br>
		Stability of earth,
		<br>
		Firmness of rock.
		<br>
		I arise today
		<br>
		Through God's strength to pilot me:
		<br>
		God's might to uphold me,
		<br>
		God's wisdom to guide me,
		<br>
		God's eye to look before me,
		<br>
		God's ear to hear me,
		<br>
		God's word to speak for me,
		<br>
		God's hand to guard me,
		<br>
		God's way to lie before me,
		<br>
		God's shield to protect me,
		<br>
		God's host to save me
		<br>
		From snares of devils,
		<br>
		From temptations of vices,
		<br>
		From everyone who shall wish me ill,
		<br>
		Afar and anear,
		<br>
		Alone and in multitude.
		<br>
		I summon today all these powers between me and those evils,
		<br>
		Against every cruel merciless power that may oppose my body and soul,
		<br>
		Against incantations of false prophets,
		<br>
		Against black laws of pagandom
		<br>
		Against false laws of heretics,
		<br>
		Against craft of idolatry,
		<br>
		Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards,
		<br>
		Against every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul.
		<br>
		Christ to shield me today
		<br>
		Against poison, against burning,
		<br>
		Against drowning, against wounding,
		<br>
		So that there may come to me abundance of reward.
		<br>
		Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me,
		<br>
		Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
		<br>
		Christ on my right, Christ on my left,
		<br>
		Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ when I arise,
		<br>
		Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,
		<br>
		Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,
		<br>
		Christ in every eye that sees me,
		<br>
		Christ in every ear that hears me.
		<br>
		I arise today
		<br>
		Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
		<br>
		Through belief in the threeness,
		<br>
		Through confession of the oneness,
		<br>
		Of the Creator of Creation.
