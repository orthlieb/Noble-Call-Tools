		<h1>Wife As Listener</h1>
		<p>
			Lord,
		</p>
		<p>
			I am willing to be made willing by Your grace. Give me the ear of
			the wise. Help me to understand my husband and live with him in
			understanding, that our prayers would not be hindered, and that we
			would be able to resolve every issue that comes up. Enable us to cast
			all these burdens on You. So Lord, I choose to be a willing woman.
			I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m afraid. I don&rsquo;t know what I am going
			to face in this conversation. But Lord, give me the grace to be strong
			in the power of Your might.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amen
