				David would pour out his heart unto the Lord, by expressing the facts as he

				Perfect love will cast out fear and when fear is cast out the need for control will
				subside.  Fear is often based on false evidence that appears real. Our natural
				inclinations when we experience fear is to either ﬁght, take ﬂight or freeze.

				When we are acting out of fear we are accessing
				the small rear part of our brain designed for quick survival thinking and when we
				are being relational we are accessing the large frontal lobes where our relational
				circuits are found. Science has recently discovered what God has been prescribing
				all along, in order to switch from the survival mode functions of the rear of the brain
				to the relational mode of the frontal lobes you need to start with a process called
				deliberate appreciation.
