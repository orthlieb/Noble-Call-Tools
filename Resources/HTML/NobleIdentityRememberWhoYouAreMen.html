		<h1>Remember Who You Are</h1>
		I am a noble man in Christ Jesus, complete in Him, which is the head of
		all principality and power. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I
		live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live
		in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
		himself for me. I willingly and generously offer myself unto God and in
		service to those He has given me. God's gentleness has made me great
		and he has redeemed me and made me safe and secure. With the love that
		I have received I am able to come with tender mercies and call my wife
		into a conversation so I can consider her troubles and know her soul in
		adversity. I can lead her into God's throne room so that He can clothe
		her in His grace in the time of need and reconnect us to Himself, to
		one another, and to our noble calling. I live with my wife in
		understanding because I have the mind of Christ and the heart of the
		Father living in me by the Spirit. When we are in one accord we can put
		10,000 to flight. God has made me to be&nbsp;fervent&nbsp;in spirit,
		mighty in the scriptures and noble in character. I desire to order my
		conversation aright and see the salvation of the Lord.
