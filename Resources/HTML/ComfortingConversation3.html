		<h1>What Question Are You Asking Yourself?</h1>
		<p>
			Discover the question that is causing the mind to search for answers. Often times
			Satan will use a question in order to capture our thoughts. Satan used this scheme
			when he asked Eve a question while in the Garden of Eden. He took her thoughts
			captive with a question.

			Men can often be <strong>deceived</strong> with false information but women are often <strong>beguiled</strong> when they are given just a few facts and left to Ô¨Åll in the rest with a
			story of their own imagination.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can ask, "What happened?" and "What are you telling yourself?" if they
			can't detect the question they are asking themselves?
