		<h1>What will the future be like if nothing changes?</h1>
		<p>This question is a real motivator for me because I begin to see the
		high cost of doing nothing. I want people to really consider just what
		the future could be and not gloss over this one. It helps everyone to
		be more committed to resolving the issue.</p>
		<p>Rephrase what you heard the person say to their satisfaction. If they
		are not satisfied that you understand, allow them to rephrase their
		statement, don&rsquo;t try to guess, but be patient until they can
		verbalize their own thoughts. A right answer is like a kiss on the
		lips, and in this case it is a answer that shows you understand them.</p>
