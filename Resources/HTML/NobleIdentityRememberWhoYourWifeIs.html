		<h1>Remember Who Your Wife Is</h1>
		My wife is a part of the family of God. She has been chosen and been
		reconciled to God, and restored as a new creation in Christ Jess, she
		is a woman, made in His image and for His glory. She is flesh of my
		flesh and bone of my bone. She is a virtuous woman in Christ
		Jesus and her value is far above rubies. God has chosen her before the
		foundation of the world that she should be holy and without blame
		before Him in love. She has been adopted as a child by Jesus Christ to
		Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, wherein He hath
		made her accepted in the Beloved. She has redemption through His blood,
		the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace that she
		should be to the praise of His glory. He is in her midst and is mighty
		to save and rejoices over her with shouts of joy. She is His bride and
		He is her bridegroom and I'm responsible to be God's unhindered conduit
		of His love. I'm called to cherish her so she can experience the love
		of God which casts out all her fears, so she can
		be without spot and wrinkle.
