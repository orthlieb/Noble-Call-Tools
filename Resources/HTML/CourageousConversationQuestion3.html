		<h1>How is this affecting you?</h1>
		<p>Questions 3 &amp; 4 deal with the painful consequences of an issue.
		The beatitude of mourning can be displayed by the listener as they show
		empathy for the other person. When a person feels heard and cared about
		they can begin to move on to resolving their issues. It is a rare
		experience for most people to feel safe enough to talk about anything
		because there are so few people who can listen from another&rsquo;s
		perspective. One definition of intimacy I like is <em>&ldquo;In To Me
		See.&rdquo;</em> When we look
		through another person&rsquo;s eyes and see as they see we can
		begin to understand why they are behaving the way they are.</p>
		<p>When you take the brunt of their intense emotions and don&rsquo;t
		defend yourself, but mourn over what you may have caused or what others
		have contributed to, you are following the command <em>&ldquo;to rejoice
		with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn.&rdquo;</em>
		It also allows you to see just how serious of an issue this is and what
		the cause and effects are for yourself and the organization.</p>
		<p>Rephrase what you heard the person say to their satisfaction. This is a
		part of engaging in the conversation and helping the person feel
		understood.</p>
