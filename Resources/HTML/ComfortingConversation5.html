		<h1>How Does It Make You Feel When You Tell Yourself This Story?</h1>
		<p>
			Satan is a deceiver and the father of lies, he will try to capture your thoughts ﬁrst,
			then he will help you create a story ﬁlled with half truths, lies and accusations so he
			can capture your emotions and ﬁnally your will.  He wants you to make unwise
			choices based on F.E.A.R. so he can kill your
			body, rob you of your ﬁnances, and destroy your relationships.

		<p>
			It becomes a story when we do not have all the facts and we need to ﬁll in the gaps
			with our own imagination or the accuser of the brethren helps us ﬁll in the gaps
			with his F.E.A.R.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is not the facts that create the emotion, it is the story we create around the facts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The meaning determines the feeling. We need to be aware of the meaning we are
			attaching to the facts and then challenge that meaning with the truth. Often times it
			means seeking counsel from others so we can recognize reality and allow truth to
			set us free.
