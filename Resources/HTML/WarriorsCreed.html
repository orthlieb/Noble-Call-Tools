		<h1>The Kingdom Soldier's Creed</h1>
		I am more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus, a member of a
		chosen generation. I serve the people of a holy nation and I live
		out the Kingdom values. I will always place the will of my Lord
		and Savior first. I will never accept defeat, for by my God I can
		run through a troop and by my God I can leap over a wall. I will
		never quit, though I stumble and fall seven times I will rise up.
		I will fight for my brethren, for my sons and my daughters, my
		wife, and my King. I take up my helmet of salvation; I put on my
		breastplate of righteousness; I gird myself with the belt of truth,
		and having my feet shod with the gospel of peace; I take up my
		sword of the Spirit and my shield of faith. I am strong in the
		grace that is in Christ Jesus. I endure hardness as a good soldier.
		I do not entangle myself with the affairs of this life that I may
		please Him Who has chosen me to be a soldier. I have consecrated myself unto the Lord, therefore He will do amazing things
		in and through me. The Lord shall cause my enemies that rise up
		against me to be smitten before my face: they shall come against
		me one way, and flee before me seven ways. I bring every thought
		captive to the obedience of Christ and tear down strongholds and
		principalities by the power of God that works mightily within
		me. I know my God; I am strong and I do great exploits. I am
		courageous; I do not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that
		flies by day. A thousand may fall at my side, ten thousand at my
		right hand, but it will not come near me because I have made the
		Most High my dwelling; He is my refuge. I love the Lord and
		acknowledge His name; He is with me in trouble and I know He
		will deliver me. I am a Soldier of the King.
