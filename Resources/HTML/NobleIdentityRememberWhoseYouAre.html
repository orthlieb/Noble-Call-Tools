		<h1>Remember Whose You Are</h1>
		<p style="font-weight: bold;">
			Psalm 103 KJV
		</p>
		<p>
			Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy
			name.
			<br>
			Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
			<br>
			Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
			<br>
			Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
			lovingkindness and tender mercies;
			<br>
			Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed
			like the eagle's.
		</p>
		<p>
			The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
			oppressed.
		</p>
		<p>
			He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
			Israel.
			<br>
			The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
			mercy.
			<br>
			He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
			<br>
			He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to
			our iniquities.
			<br>
			For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward
			them that fear him.
			<br>
			As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
			transgressions from us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that
			fear him.
			<br>
			For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
			<br>
			As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he
			flourisheth.
			<br>
			For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof
			shall know it no more.
			<br>
			But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them
			that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
			<br>
			To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
			commandments to do them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom
			ruleth over all.
			<br>
			Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
			commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
			<br>
			Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his
			pleasure.
			<br>
			Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			Bless the LORD, O my soul.
