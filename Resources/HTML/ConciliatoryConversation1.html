		<h1>Why Have a Conciliatory Conversation?</h1>
		Conciliatory conversations are important because they remove guilt so
		we can love from a pure heart, a good conscience and a sincere faith.
		If we don't properly deal with guilt then we will seek to justify
		ourselves. The main way we justify ourselves is through blame, which
		leads to the stronghold of resentment, which leads to despising and
		eventually it becomes a root of bitterness. The conciliatory
		conversation will free us from guilt and bitterness that comes from an
		unforgiving heart. When we ask forgiveness we are keeping
		short accounts, we are not building up overdue emotional debt that
		needs reconciled.

		You will receive the level of honor according to the level of humility
		you go to. In this conversation there are four levels of an
		apology as well as four degrees of humility. Jesus shows us how to
		esteem the needs of others as higher than our own in Philippians 2:1-9
		as he humbled himself by becoming a man, then a servant, then a public
		scourging and death on a cross, now his name is above every other
		name. The law of the universe dictates that
		humility comes before honor.

		<h1>When to Have a Conciliatory Conversation</h1>
		When we realize we have sinned against someone or offended a person and
		we need to leave our gift at the altar and make things right with man
		before continuing our worship before God. Unforgiveness can keep us
		linked to the pain of the past versus releasing people and cutting off
		the enemy's attacks through forgiving one another.
		<br>
		<h1>How to Have a Conciliatory Conversation </h1>
		Often times we only deal with the surface problem and we argue about
		the interpretation of one another's actions and intentions. Forgiveness
		is not justifying, forgetting, excusing or denying the pain of
		someone's sin nor is it not counting men's sins against them.

		Forgiveness is an act of the will in which we choose to give up
		our right to hold another person accountable for the wrong they have
		done to us. We cannot hold unto a person in order to settle the score.
		Forgiveness is letting go and releasing a person from any future claims
		against them.
		<br>
		<br>
		Ultimately, you need to determine the Four Levels of the Problem and go
		through the Four Levels of Forgiveness.
