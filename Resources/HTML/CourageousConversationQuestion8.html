		<h1>What is the most powerful thing we can agree to ask God for?</h1>
		<p>This question is an acknowledgment of Psalm 55:22. We are to cast back
		on the Lord all our burdens that a conversation like this can create.
		We now know our responsibilities and the preferable future and we will
		either try to do it in the power of our flesh or we will cast our burdens on the Lord
		and acknowledge our weakness and dependence on Him to perform all
		things for us. When we agree in prayer right then we invite
		God&rsquo;s power to impact this issue. Psalm 133 says that God
		commands a blessing when brethren dwell together in unity.</p>
