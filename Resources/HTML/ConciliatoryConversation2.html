		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Four Levels of the Problem</h1>
		<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Level 1: Surface Problems</span></h2>
		These are hurtful words, actions and attitudes and represent the <span
		style="font-style: italic;">content</span> of words or actions.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What did you hear me say?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What did you see me do?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Remember that what someone else sees or hears may not be what you
				intended or even what you thought you said or did. The important thing
				is not to determine whose perspective is correct but more that you
				understand the other person's perspective. Many times what we say or do
				can speak into other's fears and get filtered negatively.
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Level 2: Surface Causes</h2>
		These are the resulting thoughts, fears, and conclusions, and represent
		the <span style="font-style: italic;">interpreted intent</span> of
		your words or actions.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What did my words,
					actions, attitudes cause you to think?"</span> This allows you to
				understand the lies that the speaker began to believe.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What meaning did you give
					to my words or actions?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"The meaning often
					determines the feeling, what did you feel?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What fears did this
					produce in you?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What painful memories did
					this trigger?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What stress did this
					cause?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What conclusions did you
					come to?"</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Level 3: Root Problem</h2>
		Regardless o your intent this is often a failure to demonstrate love or
		respect and a lack of vital character qualities (see the 49 Character
		Qualities of Christ).
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ask<span style="font-style: italic;"> "How did I fail to
					demonstrate love or respect to you?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask<span style="font-style: italic;"> "What character qualities
					did I fail to demonstrate?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What qualities do you
					need to see in me?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What does this failure
					cause you to think or do?"</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Level 4: Root Cause</h2>
		This root cause is us resisting God&rsquo;s grace in our pride and
		stubbornness.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"What do you perceive I am
					unwilling to do?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"How did I resist
					God&rsquo;s grace in this situation?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"How did I demonstrate
					pride to you?"</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask <span style="font-style: italic;">"How did my stubbornness
					affect you?"</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
