		<h1>Remember Who Your Husband Is</h1>
		My husband is a noble man in Christ Jesus, complete in Him,
		which is the head of all principality and power: he is crucified with
		Christ: nevertheless he lives, yet not him, but Christ liveth in him:
		and the life which he now lives in the flesh, he lives by faith in the
		Son of God, who loved him, and gave Himself for him. He
		willingly and generously offers himself unto God and in service to
		those He has given him. God's gentleness has made him great and He
		has redeemed him and made him safe and secure. With the love
		that he has received, he is able to
		come with tender mercies and call me into a conversation
		so he can consider my troubles and know my soul in adversity. He can
		lead me into God's throne room so that He can clothe
		me with His grace in the time of need and reconnect us to
		Himself, one another, and to our noble calling. My husband lives with
		me in understanding because he has the mind of Christ and the heart of
		the father living in him by the Spirit. When we are in one accord we
		can put 10,000 to flight. God has made him to be fervent in spirit,
		mighty in the scriptures, and noble in character. He desires to order
		his conversation aright and see the salvation of the Lord.
