    To “salute one another” means to envelope in the arms of your heart.
    Greetings answer a very big question in the heart of people.
    “Do you delight in me and are you glad to see or be with me?”<br>
    <ul>
      <li>How does a high D, I, S, or C like to be greeted? Consider
        their characteristics:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dominance</b>: People who score high in the intensity of
          the "D" styles factor are very active in dealing with problems
          and challenges, while low "D" scores are people who want to do
          more research before committing to a decision. High "D" people
          are described as demanding, forceful, egocentric, strong
          willed, driving, determined, ambitious, aggressive, and
          pioneering. <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Influence:</b> People with high "I" scores influence
          others through talking and activity and tend to be emotional.
          They are described as convincing, magnetic, political,
          enthusiastic, persuasive, warm, demonstrative, trusting, and
          optimistic. <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Steadiness:</b> People with high "S" styles scores want a
          steady pace, security, and do not like sudden change. High "S"
          individuals are calm, relaxed, patient, possessive,
          predictable, deliberate, stable, consistent, and tend to be
          unemotional and poker faced. <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Compliance:</b> People with high "C" styles adhere to
          rules, regulations, and structure. They like to do quality
          work and do it right the first time. High "C" people are
          careful, cautious, exacting, neat, systematic, diplomatic,
          accurate, and tactful. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>What would make you believe I am glad to see and be with you
        when we first see each other in the morning or when we get back
        together at the end of the day or from being away from one
        another?</li>
    </ul>
